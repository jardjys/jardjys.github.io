        Ilse Gallegos is a recently graduated nutritionist who has been working in ISSSTE (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado).

      After explaining to her our project she answered some of our questions and gave us some feedback.
    She told us that our idea of having the children counting how much calories they eat per day is not healthy for them. They could develop eating disorders and be obsessed about food when they grow up.  She recommended us to have the calorie counter as a tool for the parents, and only the parents can access it. 
    </div>
    <div class= "textin">
      She told us that the games are a great idea for the kids to get interested in a healthy diet and to learn about what they should or shouldn’t eat. As well to teach them the different sports they can try. 
    She also suggested us to have a page where the kids can calculate their body mass index but instead of having it tell them they are overweight or obese, tell them they have to eat healthy and exercise, also she said it would be good to keep track of this and show the kids the progress they’ve made since they first sign up.

    <div class = "textin">
      When we asked her if she thought this app will accomplish its purpose she answered it would if we go to a school and try it with the kids. She said it is necessary to keep updating the app so the children won’t lose interest.

    <div class="Interview">
      <b>Interview to a Potential User</b>
      </div>
      <div class="textin">
        We talked to a potential user for this interview, his name is Jorge, he’s an 8 years old Elementary school’s student with some obesity problems. When we talked to Jorge we discovered a few things that are important for us.
First we asked him of he minded being called chubby, and he said he didn’t care at all. He is not focused on weight losing right now, he’s not a bullied kid, so he doesn’t mind. He also said that he ate whatever he wanted and he wanted to stay like that, obviously little does he know that’s not a healthy way to eat.
We asked him if he would use our application and told him what it was about. He said he’d definitely use it only if “the games were fun”, textually, but not with the purpose of losing weight. 
We asked him what he’d like to see in our page according to our purpose and he said it would be cool to give the kids advice on how to eat properly, but still letting them eat “cool stuff” and explain that with outstanding games. 
We reached the conclusion that kids that age are not concerned about their physical condition and are not into making an effort to lose weight even though they’re being bullied, and that they want a really interactive way to tell them all of the information we got so they get it implicitly by playing the games and watching videos.
