        <p style="font-family: arial; serif;color:black;margin-left:14px;"> 1.- Install a counter at the entrance an another at the exit. 
        This way when the bus is full the driver won’t be able to open the front doors, only the back ones. A screen in the front of the bus will display how many places are available, for people in the stations to be aware of this, before they enter the bus.</p>
        <p style="font-family: arial; serif;color:black;margin-left:14px;">2.- Enroll a whole system of purchasable tickets at the stopping place
        With this method, drivers won’t have any kind of control of money, a counter will be in charge of making your ticket valid and allowing you to enter.</p>
        <p style="font-family: arial; serif;color:black;margin-left:14px;">3.- Give a fixed salary to the driver
        Having well paid salary will help in having less cases of corruption and is more likely that the driver  gives a good service.</p>
