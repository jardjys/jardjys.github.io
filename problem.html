	<p style="font-family: arial; serif;color:black;margin-left:14px;"> Like it is known, public transportation in all over Mexico represents a problem among passengers. For some people there is just no option in mobilization, than to take the bus and they have to face a series of negative aspects of it, for example, the insecurity inside the bus or the constant overcrowding of it caused by the bus driver, only because they get paid by ticket commission.</p>
	
	<p>Corruption also represents a major problem, some bus drivers are known for reselling the 'transvales' tickets, that are tickets paid by half of its price, only sold for students and elder people.</p>
