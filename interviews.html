	  	After explaining to her our project she answered some of our questions and gave us some feedback.
		She told us that our idea of having the children counting how much calories they eat per day is not healthy for them. They could develop eating disorders and be obsessed about food when they grow up.  She recommended us to have the calorie counter as a tool for the parents, and only the parents can access it.

 	  	She told us that the games are a great idea for the kids to get interested in a healthy diet and to learn about what they should or shouldn’t eat. As well to teach them the different sports they can try. 
		She also suggested us to have a page where the kids can calculate their body mass index but instead of having it tell them they are overweight or obese, tell them they have to eat healthy and exercise, also she said it would be good to keep track of this and show the kids the progress they’ve made since they first sign up.

	  	When we asked her if she thought this app will accomplish its purpose she answered it would if we go to a school and try it with the kids. She said it is necessary to keep updating the app so the children won’t lose interest.
